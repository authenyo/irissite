the (fourth? idk ive been doing ts too long its been 2 years) rewrite of my site going back to the old days and using RAW html and css I HATE ALL STATIC SITE GENERATORS

this is currently hosted on https://authenyo.xyz (clearnet) and http://authen7lfz4b3bb7dlt57vphk47tz7vpkz2o6htjg6gy734zjxfobsqd.onion (tor)

you can use any webserver for testing/dev if you want to pr but i personally just cd public and run python3 -m http.server
